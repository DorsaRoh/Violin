# Violin
### A virtual violin simulator and game in Greenfoot (Java framework).

The player is presented with two options: Free play and Tile play.
Free play allows the user to play any melody they wish by having full access to the functionalities of the game. The objective of Tile play is to have the user press the right key at the right time, which is determined by the tiles that appear from the top of the screen. When each tile is pressed correctly, it will emit its appropriate musical note. The tiles played correctly will produce the level's corresponding song.
